    summary: |
      I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of English Linguistics at Kyung Hee University, Seoul. 
      My research areas are Syntax and Corpus Linguistics in English and Korean. 
      Currently, I am working on English ellipsis constructions such as as-parentheticals and stripping constructions from a Construction Grammar (CxG) perspective with my advisor Prof. Jong-Bok Kim.
      My doctoral dissertation examines the elliptical distributions of stripping constructions in various adverbial clauses in English.
