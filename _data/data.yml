    title: About me
    summary: "I am a syntactician with research interests at the syntax-semantics interface. I am also interested in corpus linguistics. 
In 2022, I received a PhD in linguistics from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (My advisor is Dr. Nicholas Fleisher). My dissertation centers on the syntax and semantics of non-standard <i>wh</i>-constructions in Korean (e.g., <i>why</i>-like <i>what</i>-interrogatives, <i>what</i>-exclamatives).
Currently, I am working as a lecturer at Kyung Hee University and Chung-Ang University."
