career-profile:
    title: About me
    summary: I am a syntactician with research interests at the syntax-semantics interface. I am also interested in corpus linguistics. 
In 2022, I received  a PhD in linguistics from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (My advisor is Dr. Nicholas Fleisher). My dissertation centers on the syntax and semantics of non-standard wh-constructions in Korean (e.g., why-like what-interrogatives, what-exclamatives).
Currently, I am working as a lecturer at Kyung Hee University and Chung-Ang University.
